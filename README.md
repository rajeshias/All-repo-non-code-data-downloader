1. To get started, you need a github token, that can be generated here: https://github.com/settings/tokens (we need all repo read permissions)
2. There is a credentials.py file, where you need to paste your github token, along with the root path, where you want the repos to be written (root_path cannot be empty)
3. You can run the main.py file
